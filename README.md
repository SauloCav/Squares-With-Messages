# React Native Squares with Messages App

This is a React Native application that renders three squares, each with a message in the center and a custom background color.

## Square Component

The app utilizes a component called `Square` that accepts two properties:

- `message`: A string representing the message displayed in the center of the square.
- `color`: A string that sets the background color of the square.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, you should have the React Native development environment set up on your machine. You can follow the [official React Native environment setup guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to do this.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SauloCav/Squares-With-Messages-React-Native/tree/main
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-native-squares-app
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm or yarn:

   With npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   With yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start the application on an emulator or real device. Make sure your emulator is running or your device is connected via USB.

Command to start the application:

```bash
npx react-native run-android # For Android
# or
npx react-native run-ios # For iOS (macOS environment only)
```

This will start the application on your emulator or device. You will see three squares with custom messages and colors on the screen.
